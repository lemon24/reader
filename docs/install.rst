Installation
============

Python versions
---------------

*reader* supports Python |min_python| and newer, and PyPy.


Dependencies
------------

These packages will be installed automatically when installing *reader*:

* `feedparser`_ parses feeds; *reader* is essentially feedparser + state.
* `requests`_ retrieves feeds from the internet;
  it replaces feedparser's default use of :mod:`urllib`
  to make it easier to write plugins.
* `werkzeug`_ provides HTTP utilities.
* `iso8601`_  parses dates in ISO 8601 / RFC 3339; used for JSON Feed parsing.
* `beautifulsoup4`_ is used to strip HTML tags before adding entries
  to the search index.
* `typing-extensions`_ is used for :mod:`typing` backports.

*reader* also depends on the :mod:`sqlite3` standard library module
(at least SQLite 3.18 with the `JSON1`_ and `FTS5`_ extensions).


.. _no-vendored-feedparser:

.. note::

  Because `feedparser`_ makes PyPI releases at a lower cadence,
  *reader* uses a vendored version of feedparser's `develop`_ branch
  by default since :ref:`version 2.9`.
  To opt out of this behavior, and make *reader* use
  the installed ``feedparser`` package,
  set the ``READER_NO_VENDORED_FEEDPARSER`` environment variable to ``1``.

.. _optional dependencies:

Optional dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Despite coming with a CLI and web application, *reader* is primarily a library.
As such, most dependencies are optional, and can be installed as `extras`_.

As of version |version|, *reader* has the following extras:

* ``cli`` installs the dependencies needed for the
  :doc:`command-line interface <cli>`.
* ``app`` installs the dependencies needed for the
  :doc:`web application <app>`.
* Specific plugins may require additional dependencies;
  refer to their documentation for details.
